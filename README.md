+ Say Hello - Endpoint
+ Create an API endpoint that can receive input (a name) and outputs a personalized greeting with the user's input (message + name)
+ Peer reviewed by Sebastian Breve-Sanchez, 15:09: The program runs as expected. Didn't break and printed a greeting with whatever name was given. Short and simple code that gets the job done. I wonder if it was always that short.
